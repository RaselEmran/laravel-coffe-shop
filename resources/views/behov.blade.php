                    <p> Coffee has always been of great importance in my life, ever since I was a kid. Here I remember clearly the visits of my grandmother. She had always bought imported coffee that was roasted with love - and it could clearly be smelled when you entered the apartment, where the air was always filled with the coffee's many aromas. But it wasn't any coffee - it was always quality coffee.</p>
                    <p>
                        Since then I have been a regular user of NespressoÂ® coffee capsules, as well as the alternatives from the supermarket. But there was nothing that could match Grandma's coffee, and so I set out to create an alternative to the expensive capsules, focusing on quality. From there, many world-wide visits with suppliers and coffee farmers began to explore the market in depth. From all the visits, we chose only the best ones that could deliver a quality that coffee lovers and my grandmother would approve.
